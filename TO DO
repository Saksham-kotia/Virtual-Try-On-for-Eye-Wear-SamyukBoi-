## 🧠 1. Make the Minor Fixes

These are small but important pre-training touch-ups:

| File                         | Fix                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DataLoadingPreprocesing.py` | Replace dummy label generation with actual labels (from filenames or metadata). |
| `MainFunction.py`            | Fix variable typo (`celeba_zip_path` → `dataset_zip_path`).                     |
| `FaceShapeClassifier.py`     | Optionally replace hardcoded labels with dynamic ones (from LabelEncoder).      |
| `CompletePipeline.py`        | Add print/log statements to monitor progress during long runs.                  |

✅ None of these change architecture — they just polish functionality.

---

## 🧩 2. Train the CNN Model

Once those edits are done:

```bash
python training_pipeline/MainFunction.py
```

That will:

* Download your dataset (UTKFace or CelebA)
* Preprocess it
* Train the CNN face shape classifier
* Save:

  * `models/face_shape_classifier.h5`
  * `models/label_encoder.pkl`

✅ After this, your FastAPI backend can **instantly start using the trained model** — no code changes needed.

## 🔗 3. Pass Integration Info to the Frontend Team

Tell them this (you can literally copy-paste 👇):

### **Frontend–Backend Integration Guide**

**Base URL:**
`http://localhost:8000` (or your deployed API URL)

**Endpoints:**

| Step                  | Endpoint                   | Method | Description                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣ Upload Image      | `/api/upload`              | POST   | Upload user face image         |
| 2️⃣ Classify Face     | `/api/classify-face-shape` | POST   | Predict face shape             |
| 3️⃣ Recommend Glasses | `/api/recommend-glasses`   | POST   | Get matching glasses           |
| 4️⃣ Virtual Try-On    | `/api/overlay`             | POST   | Overlay chosen glasses on face |

**Static Directories:**

* `/accessories/glasses/` → Eyewear PNGs
* `/outputs/demo_images/` → Generated try-on results
* `/outputs/user_uploads/` → User face uploads

**Required Metadata:**

* `accessories/metadata.json` — list of all glasses and their properties.

**Response Example (Overlay):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "overlaid_image_path": "outputs/demo_images/<id>_overlay.png",
  "overlay_params": {
    "center": [310, 245],
    "width": 145,
    "angle": 0.03,
    "scale": 0.97
  }
}
```

---

✅ Once they use those routes, your backend + frontend will sync perfectly.

---

## 🚀 4. (Optional) Add One Combined Route

Later, if you want a single API call that:

> Uploads → Classifies → Recommends → Overlays

I can help you add `/api/complete-tryon` which automates all 4 steps behind one endpoint — super helpful for production demos or simplified frontend calls.

---

### 🎯 TL;DR

You’ve now completed:
✅ Data pipeline
✅ Training module
✅ Backend service architecture
✅ End-to-end API integration
✅ Frontend readiness
